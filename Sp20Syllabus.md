Catalog Description
===================

Introduces students to computational problems solving techniques with common computer languages used in the physical sciences. Begins with programming basics of data handling, visualization tools, random number generators, functions, and control statements and expands to more advanced topics of interpolation, numeric integration, numeric derivatives, ordinary differential equations, and some Monte Carlo techniques. Topics are explored contextually using physical models and problems.

Course Goals and Objectives
===========================

The goal of this course is to learn the basics of programming and numerical computational techniques and to apply them to physical models and problems. We will accomplish these goals through the programming languages of MATLAB and Python (with a little Mathematica). While the syntax of each language may be unique, the concepts carry through all computer languages. In fact, after learning one language, it becomes easier to learn another.

Another implicit goal that I will emphasize throughout this course is *self-sufficiency*. The ability to find resources **on your own** is an important life skill. MATLAB, Python, and Mathematica are vast programming languages that have added functionality seemingly every month. This makes them very powerful but very hard to encompass all their potential; there\'s always something new. **To master these languages, you will need to read, learn on your own, try things and** *fail at them (possibly many times)*, **modify your approach, and then try them again. **

However, you are not completely alone. Think of me as a guide, your classmates as fellow travelers, and yourself as an explorer. We are all exploring this programming realm together, using each other as resources, and learning as we trek ahead into the fringes of our own knowledge.

The explicit learning objectives of Physics 1211 are

-   Determine the necessary sequence of steps required to accomplish a specific task

-   Generate a pseduocode algorithm to accomplish a specific task

-   Analyze an existing piece of code to determine its function and components

-   Synthesize different pieces of code into something useful in a new context

-   Write functions to control computer input and output

-   Write Monte Carlo algorithms

-   Implement programs involving lists and arrays

-   Execute program control statements (if, for, while loops)

-   Numerically integrate using MATLAB and Python

-   Analytically integrate using Mathematica

-   Numerically differentiate using MATLAB and Python

-   Analytically differentiate using Mathematica

-   Numerically solve differential equations using MATLAB

-   Solve systems equations using MATLAB and Python

-   Execute basic mathematical functions using MATLAB, Mathematica, and Python

-   Perform data-manipulation, -fitting and -visualization using MATLAB and Python

-   Produce a program in Python that calls functions from other languages

-   Check validity of computational output

Skills Checklist
----------------

We will be diving into several different languages and exploring different programming skills. You will see parallels among the languages; learning a skill in one makes it easier to implement that skill in other languages. This IS only a semester course, so we will obviously be emphasizing different algorithms in different languages. However, you can always double check your understanding by implementing programming skills across all the languages that we encounter.

Course Textbook
===============

There is no "official" textbook for this course. I will frequently use *Computational Physics* by Mark Newman; you can download most of this text at <http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cp/>. This text looks at programming exclusively through the Python language, but it also contains universal principles applicable to all languages. For a more MATLAB focused text, I use *Numerical Computing with MATLAB*. You can download it for free at <http://www.mathworks.com/moler/index_ncm.html>.

Be warned: *do not only look to your text for information*. Useful information about programming is littered throughout the internet. Part of this course will be learning how to use those resources. MATLAB, Mathematica, and Python have extensive online documentation; **don\'t be afraid to use it**. There are hundreds of *Youtube* videos showing how to program MATLAB and Python; watch them.

Online Resources
================

I have gathered several links that contain useful resources. Use them during the semester, and please share any resources that you find with me and your fellow students. The links below AND many others are located on the Blackboard site for this course under Links. I will add more links throughout the semester as people find new resources.

-   <http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab>

-   <https://www.python.org/>

In addition to using online resources, you will submit most (hopefully all) of your work through the course\'s Blackboard site or through GitHub (more on this later).

Grading and Expectations
========================

The course grading with follow the

Midterm 10%

Assignments 50%

Projects 20%

Final Project 20%

Final Project
=============

In lieu of a final exam, a Final Project will be due in Week 14. The Final Project should address some computational problem in physics that integrates *at least 4 computational methods* in the analysis. You will submit a written report, specifying why your problem is interesting; code; and **possibly** an oral presentation. The topic of the final project is entirely up to you, but subject to approval by the instructor. The projects and in-class problems are great starting points for ideas. You may expand on some program that came from a project or in-class problem. Think of possible projects throughout the semester, making special notes of any problem that sounds interesting to you. Additional details will be provided later in the semester.

**A topic for the Final Project must be emailed to the instructor by class time on March 9.**

Instructional Approach
======================

The instructional approach will be active learning. I will present the highlights of a particular topic. By no means is my presentation an exhaustive exploration of the topic. Students will learn methods of scientific computation by actively performing tasks outlined in assignments and projects. Expect to be working for much of the class time. Students are encouraged to work in groups inside and outside of class, but students are responsible for submitting their own original work.

Academic Honesty
================

Academic integrity is essential in science and engineering and students in this course are expected to follow the highest standards of academic honesty. Cheating, plagiarism, dishonesty, or other academic misconduct will result in appropriate disciplinary action. For a detailed statement, see the University policy on Academic Honesty found at http://www.northeastern.edu/osccr/academichonesty.html.

Help
====

If you have trouble with understanding concepts or with homework, seek help immediately. Please form study groups early and use my office hours; I have them for a reason.

**Formal and Informal Accommodations:** I am committed to assisting students requiring special accommodations for circumstances that are registered with the [Disability Resource Center (DRC)](http://www.northeastern.edu/drc), phone (617) 373-4428. If you have an accommodation letter from the DRC, please give it to me as early as possible in the semester or as soon as you receive the letter. If you are not formally registered with the DRC and have anxiety, depression, learning disabilities, or other issues that affect your ability to fully participate and learn in this class, I encourage you to check in with me as you feel comfortable so that we can figure out what kind of support you need to thrive in this class.

**Inclusion and Diversity:** I value all students regardless of their background, country of origin, race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or disability status, and am committed to providing a climate of excellence and inclusiveness within all aspects of the course. If there are aspects of your culture or identity that you would like to share with me as they relate to your success in this class, I would be happy to meet to discuss. Also, if you have any concerns in this area or are facing any special issues or challenges, I encourage you to discuss the matter with me as you feel comfortable, with assurance of full confidentiality (only exception being mandatory reporting of NU Academic Integrity Policy violations and [Title IX](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/frontpage/faq/sex.html) sex and gender discrimination).
