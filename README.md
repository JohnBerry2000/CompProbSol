# CompProbSol
This repository will contain all the notebooks, programs, and other material for Physics 1211 in the Spring 2019 semester. **Please do not push anything to this repository.** You should instead copy material over to your own repository and push your work from there.
## Code_Examples
This folder will contain all the Jupyter and MATLAB notebooks. These notebooks will contain the computational topics covered in class. Use them to explore a topic and to gather code examples. This folder should also contain any example code files - you should feel free to use them.
## Assignments
This folder will contain all the assignment and project descriptions. Staring code files will also be stored here. These starting files will be needed to complete the assignment or project.
