# New knowledge
1. Python function analogous `numel` - `numpy.count_nonzero()`
1. Add labels to plots `xlabel`, `ylabel` and `title`
1. using `plot` in MATLAB/Python returns an object you can manipulate
1. Separate functions into separate lines to help troubleshoot
1. know where your files are stored
1. Sort your lists - MATLAB - `sort()` Python - 'sorted()'
1. Output your variables to debug
1. `len` in python counts elements like `numel` in MATLAB
1. new line character '\n' ('\t' as well) can help with outputting nice looking text
1. when graphing, `figure` will open new figure
1. `hold on` and `hold off` allows you to plot in same figure
1. `legend` allows you to input labels to graphs containing multiple lines 
1. Mac paths must right click on file, click option - copy path to clipboard
2. cos/sin functions take radians, but there are functions cosd/sind that take degrees.
1. It might be useful to write the program in pen and paper before using the computer.
## Functions
1. Consistent, meaningful variable names
1. `nargin` number of arguments into function/`nargout` gives the number of output arguments
2. `varargin` and `varargout` are alternative ways of getting input and output. Offers flexibility
