# New knowledge
## General
1. Python function analogous `numel` - `numpy.count_nonzero()`
1. Add labels to plots `xlabel`, `ylabel` and `title`
1. using `plot` in MATLAB/Python returns an object you can manipulate
1. Separate functions into separate lines to help troubleshoot
1. know where your files are stored
1. Sort your lists - MATLAB - `sort()` Python - 'sorted()'
1. Output your variables to debug
1. `len` in python counts elements like `numel` in MATLAB
1. new line character '\n' ('\t' as well) can help with outputting nice looking text
1. Mac paths must right click on file, click option - copy path to clipboard
2. cos/sin functions take radians, but there are functions cosd/sind that take degrees in Python and MATLAB.
1. It might be useful to write the program in pen and paper before using the computer.
1. Default arguments should be specified from the last argument in.
## Plots
1. Add labels to plots `xlabel`, `ylabel` and `title`
1. using `plot` in MATLAB/Python returns an object you can manipulate
1. when graphing, `figure` will open new figure
1. `hold on` and `hold off` allows you to plot in same figure
1. `legend` allows you to input labels to graphs containing multiple lines 
1. Look at data, plot a function, before making a plan on how to analyze it


## MATLAB Functions
1. Consistent, meaningful variable names
1. `nargin` number of arguments into function/`nargout` gives the number of output arguments
2. `varargin` and `varargout` are alternative ways of getting input and output. Offers flexibility
1. In MATLAB, don't name a live script and regular file the same .

## MATLAB 
1. AppDesigner or GUIDE allows to create GUIs
1. The equation editor is less annoying than the latex syntax in Jupyter.
1. Ode solvers come in a variety of methods, which one to use depends on the behavior of your equation
1. in live script, error messages might not be able to be copied to use as search terms in google.
1. Live scripts may have strange copy and paste properties in general, because of rich text format

## Python Functions
1. lambda functions are python's anonymous functions
1. In pandas `read_csv` we must be aware of the encoding of the file (for instance project, the csv is encoded latin-1)
1. `filter` takes a boolean, and returns the elements where the boolean is true, much like a MATLAB indexing.
1. Be aware of `vectorize` in python. This language is less automatic about handling arrays.

## Python
1. Use Pandas! for data
1. You can define environments and install packages through the anaconda navigator
1. Terminals are necessary for not widely used python packages
1. Jupyter supports latex syntax
1. Visual python can be run in jupyter notebooks as well.
