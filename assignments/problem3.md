Problem {#problem .unnumbered}
-------

From now on, we need to share files in a way that allows the most
up-to-date versions are accessible to all concerned parties. I have gone
through the highlights of the features of *GitHub*, and I hope that you
see the benefit of such a system. All assignments will be "turned in"
using this system. (Really, all you have to do is keep your code files
in the folders that correspond to your repository on *GitHub*). Let's
get it set up. **There are many ways to accomplish the following tasks;
find the easiest way for you**

1.  `clone` the repository `CompProbSol` and store in on your local
    drive. This repo will contain homework assignments and example code
    and will be updated before every class period.

2.  Create a repository in the `Phys1211` organization at
    <https://github.com/Phys1211>. Name it:
    `[firstname initial][lastname]` with no spaces.

3.  `Push` all the code files up to the repository and check that they
    are present on GitHub.

4.  Now let's update the script files `satellites.m` and `satellite.py`:

    1.  Change the input prompt printed to the command line to a
        meaningful statement that includes what units the input should
        be reported in.

    2.  Modify the program so that it also calculates and prints the
        velocity $v$ of the satellite at a particular $h$.

    3.  Round off the orbital altitude and velocity before printing
        them.

    4.  Include code in the programs that produces a plot of $h$ vs $T$
        and a plot of $h$ vs $v$ with labels. (This will be more
        difficult in python, you'll have to import the
        *matplotlib.pyplot* package, see what you can do.)

    5.  Be imaginative and add any other flourishs to the program.

5.  Finally, push these modified files up to you GitHub repository and
    check at `github.com` that you were successful
