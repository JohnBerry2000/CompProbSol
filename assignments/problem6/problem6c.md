# Problem 6c "Writing a Function, part III: Error Handling"
## Outcomes
- Use functions definitions to create an original program
- Create MException Objects in MATLAB
- Use the `try/catch` statement in MATLAB
- Implement exception objects in Python
- Use the `try/except` statement in Python
## Problem 
You will be modifying your projectile motion functions that you wrote in Problem 6a and 6b. There are many ways that your program could go wrong. Using exceptions in MATLAB and Python allow you to mitigate the effects of errors in your program. 
## Procedure
1. In MATLAB, include *at least* 2 user-defined errors in the program. These errors could define mistakes such as wrong units or misordered inputs.
1. 
 
 Have fun and include your own touches.
## Running your program
You should include a MATLAB Live script and Jupyter Notebook in your repository that contains example of several calls to your projectile functions, displaying the ways it handles certain errors.
## At the end ..
At the end you should have:
- a `.py` file and containing your satellite and projectile functions with any "auxiliery" functions you require.
- a `.ipynb` file containing calls to run your Python projectile function. 
- a `.m` file containing your projectile function.
- a.`.mlx' file containing calls to run your MATLAB projectile function.
