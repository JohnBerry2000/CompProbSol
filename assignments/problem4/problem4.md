Problem \#4 *hip, hip, array* 
=======================

**NAME**:

Outcomes 
--------

-   Load data in MATLAB and Python

-   Use arrays and indexing to filter data

Problem 
-------
Instead containing or representing one value, arrays can contain many values, often of different data types. Today, I want you to load data about the periodic Table into MATLAB and Python. In each language, you should construct a script that uses indexing to sift through the data and answer various questions about it.

1.  `pull` the repository `CompProbSol`. There should be a number of updates the repository.

2.  Open the scripts `loadmat.m` and `loadtext.py`. Save these scripts and the files name `smallperiodictable.xx` to your personal repository set up the other day. This programs will be the starting point for today's problem.

3.  Each script contains code that will load the data from `smallperiodictable.xx` into MATLAB or spyder. Once `loadmat.m` is executed, MATLAB should have 7 columns containing the names, atomic weights, atomic numbers, symbols, densities, number of isotopes, and discovery year for the first 99 elements of the periodic table. Once `loadtext.py` Spyder should contain 1 data structure with the same data about the first 99 elements of the periodic table.

4.  Use indexing (no `if` or `for` loops) to answer the questions below
