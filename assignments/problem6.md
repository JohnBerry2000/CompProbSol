# Problem 6
## Outcomes
- Use control statements to check input and output
- Parse input using character and string data types

## Problem 
You will be writing a script that calculates the range and time of flight of a projectile given the initial launch velocity and angle. You can ignore air resistance, for now. After learning how differential equations work in MATLAB/Python, we will return to this function to incorporate air resistance (and maybe the Coriolis effect).
## Procedure
1.  Review the kinematic equations for 2D projectile motion.
1.  Use your satellite script as a template for how to accept input from the user. 
1.  Write a script that asks for the initial velocity and launch angle of a projectile and gives the
horizontal distance traveled (aka the range) and the flight time of the projectile. Make sure to:

  1.  Accept velocities in mph and m/s
  1.  Check that the input is valid.
  1.  Only accept launch angles between 0 and 90 degrees
  1.  Graph the trajectory of the projectile. Maybe try to use an animated line
## Check your program
Does a 30 m/s projectile launched at 30^\circ travel 79.5 m in 3.05 s?

Does a 45 mph projectile launched at 65^\circ travel 103.7 feet in 3.73 s?
