Problem \#10 *Choose your own adventure: Mathematica Edition* 
=======================

**NAME**:

Outcomes 
--------

-   Use Mathematica to solve a classic introductory/modern physics problem
-   Implement functions, list index, and visualizations in Mathematica


## Problem 
Everyone in this class is enrolled in another Physics course this semester. I want this assignment to draw on those other courses and to accomplish two things:
- Introduce you to the workflow of Mathematica 
- Form a better understanding of a introductory/modern physics problem

In this assignment, I want people to choose a homework problem from another course and solve it using Mathematica. At some point in this problem, you must 
- create a function(s)
- produce visualizations
- use `manipulate`
Use this as an opportunity to finish homework in two courses at once. I would even suggest showing this program to the professor who assigned the problem. Show them the initiative you possess. 

If you are having trouble thinking a problem that Mathematica could help with, please consult with me.
