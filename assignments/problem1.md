_Figure Number_


##Outcomes

* Associate a common list of instructions to parts of a computer program
* Identify any underlying assumptions in our thinking


##Procedure

\item{Look at the figure.}
\item{Write a step-by-step procedure that would allow someone to redraw your figure (\emph{no pictures}). Try to limit one yourself to ONE action per step}
\item{Exchange your instructions with another team.}
\item{Use the new instructions to reconstruct the other team's figure.}
\item{Compare your reconstruction to the original.}


##Questions

1. When writing instructions, did you use any conventions to shorten or simplify your written instructions?
1. Did you repeat any instructions?
1. What was the hardest part of writing the instructions?
