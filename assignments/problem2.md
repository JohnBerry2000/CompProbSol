# Problem \#2  
*Altitude of a Satellite*

**NAME**:

## Outcomes

  - <span>Write a script in MATLAB *and* Python</span>

  - <span>Write a routine to capture user input</span>

## Problem

A satellite is to be launched into a circular orbit around the Earth so
that it orbits the planet once every \(T\) seconds.

## Procedure

1.  <span>Show that the altitude \(h\) *above the Earth’s surface* the
    satellite must have is
    $$h = \left(\frac{GMT^2}{4\pi^2}\right)^{1/3} - R,$$ where \(G\) is
    Newton’s gravitational constant, \(M\) is the mass of the Earth, and
    \(R\) is the radius of the Earth. </span>

2.  <span>Write a program in MATLAB that asks the user to enter the
    desired value of \(T\) (in hours) and then prints the required
    altitude of the satellite in *kilometers*.</span>

3.  <span>Write a program in Python that asks the user to enter the
    desired value of \(T\) (in hours) and then prints the required
    altitude of the satellite in *kilometers*.</span>

## Questions

1.  <span>Use your **programs** (yes, check that they give the same
    answers) to calculate the altitudes of satellites that orbit the
    Earth once a day (“geosynchronous” satellites), once every 90
    minutes, and once every 45 minutes. What do you conclude from the
    last of these numbers about the period of satellites? If you’re not
    sure (or even if you are) plot \(h\) vs \(T\) (*whoa\! whoa\! How do
    we plot? We haven’t talked about this...*). What does the plot seem
    to indicate? </span>

2.  <span>Technically a geosynchronous satellite orbits the Earth once
    per **sidereal day**, which is 23.93 hours. Why is this? Wait, what
    is the difference between a sidereal day and a solar day? What is
    the difference in altitude of a satellite orbiting Earth every
    sidereal day and that of a satellite orbiting every solar
    day?</span>
