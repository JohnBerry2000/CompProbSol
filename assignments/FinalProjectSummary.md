# Final Project Summary
### Due March 14 at 5:00 pm

In preparation for the final project, you will submit a brief summary outlining more details about your plans. In this summary, you will specify:
- the topic
- the scope (what are you going to do with this topic)
- the type of program you will write
- the objectives your project will achieve

In essence, *you* are outlining your project and how you will tell if it's successful. This summary isn't necessarily the last word, you can amend it in the future. 
This summary does not need to be long - 2 paragraphs should be enough. Be concise, say what you mean, and mean what you say.
