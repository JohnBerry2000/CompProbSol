Problem \#4a "Add some structure to your life" 
=======================

Outcomes 
--------

-   Load data in MATLAB
-   Format the data into `structs` and `tables`
-   Use indexing to filter data

Problem 
-------
Instead of working with many separate but related arrays, you can construct `tables` and `structures` of related data not of the same type. Today, I want you to load data about the periodic table into MATLAB as a `table` and as a `struct` OR import them in any way and transform them into a `table` or a `struct`. You should then construct a script that uses indexing to sift through the data and answer various questions about it.

1.  `pull` the repository `CompProbSol`. You should get in the habit of doing this first.

2.  Ensure that all the data files from the problem 4 folder of `CompProbSol` are on your computer in a folder you can safely modify files.

5. Write a new script that imports the data from smallperiodictable.txt OR smallperiodictable.csv (choose 1 file to work with, same data, different format) into MATLAB as a table AND a struct. The exact method is up to you.

4.  In the same script, answer the following questions using the data formatted as a `table` and as a `structure` **(no `if` or `for` loops)**. Your program should answer these questions when run, **you should NOT be typing out the answers in comments at any point**.

Questions 
-------

1. How many elements sink in mercury, in their natural form, AND also have fewer than 30 known isotopes? List those elements in alphabetical order.

2. What is the average atomic weight of elements discovered in the 20th century? List those elements' symbol.

3. What are the elements with the most isotopes? List the top ten elements by number of isotopes.

4. *Question whose answer can appear in comments:* Are tables or structures easier to deal with when processing data? When would using structures be advantageous?
